<h1>SlackBook User Guide</h1>

SlackBook is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) that has the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is a productivity tool purpose-built for HR departments to handle the increasing administrative load of a growing company. Experienced HR professionals who are familiar with the tasks they need to perform but whose productivity are bottlenecked by the tools they’re using will stand to benefit the most, as for the fast typers, SlackBook can perform day-to-day contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI-based apps.

## Quick start

1. **Ensure you have Java `17` or above** installed in your Computer.<br>
   ***Mac users:*** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. **Download** the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/releases).

3. **Copy** the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for SlackBook.

**Run the app**:
4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in (e.g. `cd Desktop\slackbook`), and use the `java -jar slackbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)
5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all employees.

   * `add_employee n/John Doe d/Engineering t/Team 3 r/Software Engineer e/john.doe@example.com p/92345678 s/Python` : Adds an employee named `John Doe` to the directory that has the department `Engineering`, is on `Team 3`, has the role of a `Software Engineer`, email `john.doe@example.com`, phone number `92345678`, and have skills in `Python`.

   * `delete_employee 3` : Prompts the confirmation of the deletion of the 3rd employee shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all employees.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.
6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add_employee n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add_employee n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets [] are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [s/SKILLS]...` can be used as `n/John Doe s/Java` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[s/SKILLS]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `s/Java`, `s/Java s/Python` or omitted entirely.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Exiting the program : `exit`

### Saving the data

Slackbook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Slackbook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Slackbook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the Slackbook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and replace the file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json` with the file from the same location on your previous computer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
